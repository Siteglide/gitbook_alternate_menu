### How our Docs are Structured

We've structured our docs to focus on 3 things:

1. :rocket: **Get Started:** These sections explain the fundamentals and help you use the out-of-the-box tools built into Siteglide. By following this section you should be able to build and semi-customise sites using the Siteglide Admin and CLI.&#x20;
2. :man\_mage: **Go Further:** This is where you'd find more detailed docs that help you really push the boundaries of all things web development. One of the biggest benefits of Siteglide over other platforms is you can go beyond the Siteglide feature set by tapping into the core infrastructure capabilities using GraphQL.
3. :eyes: **Reference:** Sometimes you just need to find a tag to insert a specific field/value or maybe you want to know the folder structure of a specific feature. Use our reference section to quickly find information and also troubleshoot issues.

### Types of Articles

Within these 3 areas you'll likely find the following types of articles:

* :bulb: **About / Introduction:** A brief overview of the topic, how it fits into the broader Siteglide ecosystem and some use-cases in which it might be worth incorporating into your sites
* :wrench: **Reference:** A brief reference guide to this feature for developers and anyone interested in code
* :deciduous\_tree: **File Structure** - If this feature involves code, the file structure will show you which folders and files are necessary and where to add them to your codebase. This will be presented in the format from which you would see it in Siteglide CLI; if you're using the code-editor in the Siteglide Admin, the structure will be very similar but will skip the first few folders in the structure and normally start with layouts.
* :small\_blue\_diamond: **Feature In Depth Articles:** Will take a feature and explain it in a little more depth
* :clipboard: **Step by Step Articles:** How to Implement a Feature or Solve a Problem
* :computer: **CLI:** Advice and tips for using CLI relevant to this feature
* :construction\_site: **SiteBuilder:** Advice and tips using SiteBuilder to create ready-to-go layouts for this feature
* :passport\_control: **Migration** - Advice and tips for migrating data of this type into Siteglide
